      <p>This ISOTYPE shows the Nobel prize winners in each category throughout 1901 to 2019. 
        By using pictographs as the marks, users can easily identify the ratio of male and female changes throughout the years. 
        </p>
        <p>In this graph, females tend to perform better at peace and literature with 12.69% and 12.93% respectively. 
          Bur poorly on physics with 1.41%. 
          However, Marie Curie has awarded physics Nobel prize twice in 1903 and 1963 respectively and has also awarded chemistry Nobel prize in 1911. 
          She has awarded the greatest number of Nobel prize in history

        <p>The symbol chart map uses to show the demographics of Nobel prize winners around the world. 
          Circle is uses as the marks to indicate the total number of Nobel laureates a country has/had. 
          A stacked bar chart is also used below to help improving the interactivity. 
          It allows user to select an interval and drag it along the x axis so any countries within the intervals will also be highlighted on the map. 
          </p>
          <p>Based on the graph, USA and European countries have very high number of laureates. 
            The varieties of laureates are also diverse; While most developing countries have only one laureate, and the most common category is peace. 
            Another interesting face is that Germany had the most laureates since 1901 to 1950. 
            However, after the loss of WWII, USA surpassed Germany and kept in #1 position ever since.

      <h3 >Ratio of Female and Male Representativity</h3>
      <p>This donut chart shows the ratio differences between male and female laureates throughout 1901 to 2019.  
        </p>
        <p>Based on the idiom, female has an increasing ratio in peace, medicine, and literature. 
          It is likely due to that more regions started to allow woman to get proper education.
          This is especially remarkable in peace field; many female from third world countries such as Iraq, Liberia, Pakistan awarded prices. </p>
